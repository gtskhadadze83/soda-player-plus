# soda-player-plus

**The main goal**: preserve player's simplicity with giving to you additional power (customization).

Patch that makes SodaPlayer **much better**.

For now it's a patch for [Soda Player](https://www.sodaplayer.com/) but if I continue development I'll make a **standalone player** like that one.

## Why patch?

Soda player isn't hard to rewrite. But I don't really have time to do it now. And because I need that functionality now I keep this patch for a moment.

<!-- - upgraded electron to latest version :fire: -->
<!-- - upgraded mpv (internal player itself) to latest version :fire::fire::fire: -->
<!-- - add save position and a lot of keyboard bindnings -->
<!-- - client redesign ... -->

## Optional Features

These features are enabled by default:

- [ ] Global Play/Pause Media key
- [x] Progress Bar
- ~~[ ] Save position for magnet & local files~~

For enabling/disabling instructions open DevTools:

- Windows: `CTRL + SHIFT + I`
- macOS: <!-- `CMD + ALT + SHIFT + D` -->, then `CMD + ALT + I`

For full list of features see [ROADMAP project](https://github.com/zardoy/soda-player-plus/projects/1).
