# soda-player-plus

**The main goal**: preserve player's simplicity with giving to you additional power (customization).

Patch that makes SodaPlayer **much better**.

For now it's a patch for [soda player](https://www.sodaplayer.com/) but if I continue development I'll make a **standalone app** like soda-player.

## Why this patch?

<!-- - upgraded electron to latest version :fire: -->
<!-- - upgraded mpv (internal player itself) to latest version :fire::fire::fire: -->
<!-- - add save position and a lot of keyboard bindnings -->
<!-- - client redesign ... -->
- [X] removed google analytics
- [ ] improve command line support
- [ ] save position for magnet & local files

Full list of feature could be found [in projects](https://github.com/zardoy/soda-player-plus/projects/1).

Sorry for mixing languages here but I don't care.

В папке `patch/` находятся файлы, которые будут заменены у SodaPlayer.
