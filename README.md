# Soda player plus

> Patch that makes SodaPlayer **much better**.

Now, I'm looking for a good modern player that supports all formats like mpc, but unfortunately I didn't find that. I'll probably make my own version of something like Soda but for now I'm using this patch as a **workaround only**.

<!-- **The main goal in future **: preserve player's simplicity with giving to you additional power (customization). -->

<!-- - upgraded electron to latest version :fire: -->
<!-- - upgraded mpv (internal player itself) to latest version :fire::fire::fire: -->
<!-- - add save position and a lot of keyboard bindnings -->
<!-- - client redesign ... -->

> Not maintained anymore. I'm done.

## Optional Features

These features are enabled by default:

- [x] Global Play/Pause Media key
- [x] Progress Bar
- [ ] Add opacity for window controls (make them visible) 
- ~~ [x] Thumbar Buttons~~ (wont fix)
- ~~[ ] Save position for magnet & local files~~ (won't fix)

For enabling/disabling instructions open DevTools:

- Windows: `CTRL + SHIFT + I`
